\nsection{Primes}
A prime number can only be exactly divided by itself
or $1$. The number $17$ is prime, but $16$ is not because
the numbers $2$, $4$ and $8$ can divide it exactly.
(Hint~$16\%4 == 0$).
\begin{exercise}
Write a program that prints out the first $n$ primes, where
$n$ is input by the user. The first $8$ primes are:
\begin{terminaloutput}
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19
\end{terminaloutput}
What is the $3000^{\rm th}$ prime~?
\end{exercise}
